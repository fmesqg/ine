# INE Portugal Data Toolkit

This repository makes it easier to access and analyze data from INE (Statistics Portugal). The INE API can be complex for newcomers, so this project provides a structured way to retrieve and process data efficiently. Additionally, it includes some of my own analyses and a GitHub workflow that checks for new indicators and provides daily RSS updates on what is new or updated.

## Features
- **Easy API Access**: A Python module to simplify data retrieval from INE.
- **Automated Updates**: A GitHub workflow that detects new indicators and generates daily RSS updates.
- **Example Analyses**: Pre-built analyses to showcase data insights.
- **Website**: A published site under `/docs` with useful information and resources.
